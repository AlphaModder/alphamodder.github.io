This was a just-for-fun project I took on to learn some GLSL and some math. It's a shader that displays a domain-colored image of an iterated function system over the complex plane. This produces quite the pretty and interesting fractal. By tweaking the parameters at the top of the code, one can explore different regions of the plane.
