# About Me

I'm Liam, and building software is what I do. You can find me wherever there are technical problems to solve and systems to architect, no matter how unconventional. Interests include but are certainly not limited to: *computer graphics, cognitive sciences, simulation software, and developer tooling*.  

On this website, you can find my contact information, portfolio, and blog. Take a look around!
